## Step 1: Choosing a language
Firstly, you need to choose a programming language that you are most comfortable with and learn its syntax. It can be anything C, C++, Java, Python or any programming language. C++, C or Java is a faster programming language in comparison to any other language also it is allowed to be used in any coding challenge or interviews. So it’s good if you choose one out of these three. Most of the competitive programmers use C++ as a base language, so if you are still confused you can go with this.

## Step 2: Setting up an IDE
You can look at a few blogs to set up IDE. Remember in rare cases output is compiler dependent so if you are in confusion then you can compare your output with CodeChef’s compiler.
