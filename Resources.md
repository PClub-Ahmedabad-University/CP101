# What is Competitive Programming?

**Programming teaches you how to think?** 

If you are a programmer you might have understood the deep meaning of these lines quoted by __*Steve Jobs*__ and you might have also experienced that even after shutting your computer you keep on thinking about programming stuff or code you have written in your project. 

Programming is fun, programming is an exercise for your brain, programming is a mental sport and when this sport is held over the internet involving a sport programmer as a contestant then it is called **Competitive Programming**.
