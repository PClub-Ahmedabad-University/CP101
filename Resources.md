## Step 1: Choosing a language
Firstly, you need to choose a programming language that you are most comfortable with and learn its syntax. It can be anything C, C++, Java, Python or any programming language. C++, C or Java is a faster programming language in comparison to any other language also it is allowed to be used in any coding challenge or interviews. So it’s good if you choose one out of these three. Most of the competitive programmers use C++ as a base language, so if you are still confused you can go with this.

## Step 2: Setting up an IDE
You can look at a few blogs to set up IDE. Remember in rare cases output is compiler dependent so if you are in confusion then you can compare your output with CodeChef’s compiler.

## Step 3: Getting familiar with your chosen language
You can practise these few problems to get familiar with your chosen language in terms of CP input and output management.

## Step 4: Kickstarting your Journey in competitive programming
These resources will kickstart & boost your journey throughout your competitive programming and will make sure that you don't find yourself stuck in pitholes of CP.

## Step 5: The Art of Debugging in programming
In any type of programming the one of the most quintessential thing is debugging but, it the most tiresome & tedious task (:p). To ease some your debugging tasks in CP, the resources given below might feel much necessary.

##  Understand the Concept of Time and Space Complexity
You need to find the best solution i.e optimal one learning these two concepts. So dig yourself into these two topics to know how much time and space an algorithm takes to solve a problem.
