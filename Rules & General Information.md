1. A new website has been developed for maintaining the Problem set and the Leaderboard throughout the event. **Participants have to register themselves using their Codeforces handle and Ahmedabad University email address**.
    
   - The Codeforces handle has to be recognised under ‘SEAS, Ahmedabad University’ organisation for the handle to be successfully registered on the website as this course is exclusively for Ahmedabad University students.
   - Kindly provide the correct Ahmedabad University email address. This address will be used to send completion certificates at the end.
   - It may take some time to reflect changes in the Leaderboard, so kindly be patient. 
   - Link to the platform: https://pclub-cp.herokuapp.com/
    
    
2. The leaderboard is rather a **record of progress** and not the **actual rank-list**. There won’t be any rankings provided to the participants. So take your time understanding and implementing the problems without any rush.

3. 2~3 contests will be organised throughout this course. Participants must take part and solve at least 1 question in each of them to be eligible for the certificate. Additionally, participants must solve at least 30 questions from the problem set to be eligible for the certificate.
    
   - *NOTE*: There might be some minor changes in the numbers above based on the response of participants.

4. This course is designed for cooperative learning. You can ask your doubts and discuss in Programming Club groups on WhatsApp or Discord and get your queries resolved.
   - WhatsApp group: https://chat.whatsapp.com/JFnE9GF85Tn8ZKXghbABF8
   - Discord server: https://discord.gg/Httn2HC 
    
5. **Do not copy** solutions for the tasks from the problem set either from the internet or from fellow participants. Enough time is available for brainstorming.
6. Resources will be shared regularly by updating the “Resources” section under [Github-Programming Club-CP101](https://github.com/Programming-Club-Ahmedabad-University/CP101)  throughout this course. 
    - These resources are general purpose resources to help kick start competitive programming. They will contain blogs and videos on basic programming concepts such as ‘Time limits’ and ‘Memory limits’ in tasks, how to tackle ‘Compilation’ and ‘Runtime errors’,  useful concepts to solve tasks A and B in contests, etc.
    - Furthermore, these resources will be valuable in learning new concepts as well as brushing up your knowledge with some timely quality practice problems.
    - And yes, _do star_ the repository if you like it!

**Special Mention**: [Jeet Karia](https://github.com/JeetKaria06) & [Rahul Chocha](https://github.com/mrchocha), developers of the platform.
