## ABOUT THE COURSE

Programming Club brings to you the **15-day** competitive programming course - CP101, for beginners where participants will get the opportunity to go through intensive resources and question sets which will enable them to kickstart their competitive programming journey and start participating in coding competitions online. 

The resources section of this course has been designed by identifying the common problems faced by beginners and by surveying the difficulties faced by our coding community. For instance, this document includes the guide to choose the best programming language for competitive programming, pointers to handle _runtime and compilation error, methods to avoid Memory Limit and Time Limit Exceeded_ while coding, the concepts/tricks needed to be able to solve at least one question in every contest, etc.

Through this course, the participants will be **provided with handpicked resources** containing **blogs, video lectures and articles** available on the internet along with relevant _40-50 CP questions_.  Additionally, mini-contests will be organised regularly for you to test the concepts learned.

The participants who will complete the course will be provided a _certificate_ of completion from the club.. The criteria to be eligible for a certificate is to **solve at least 30 questions from the problem set and solve at least 1 question in each of the contests organised.**

  - Only Ahmedabad University students are allowed to participate.
  - **The course is specially designed for those who want to start competitive programming** and want to start solving at least one question in coding contests.
